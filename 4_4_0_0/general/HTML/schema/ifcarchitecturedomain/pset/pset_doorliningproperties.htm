<tr><td>LiningDepth</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifcpositivelengthmeasure.htm">IfcPositiveLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
The depth of the lining.
For a door, it is the depth of the door lining, measured perpendicular to the plane of the door lining. If omitted (and with a given value to lining thickness) it indicates an adjustable depth (i.e. a depth that adjusts to the thickness of the wall into which the occurrence of this door style is inserted).

</td></tr>
<tr><td>LiningThickness</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifcnonnegativelengthmeasure.htm">IfcNonNegativeLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Thickness of the lining.
For a door, it is the thickness of the door lining as explained in the figure above. If LiningThickness value is 0. (zero) it denotes a door without a lining (all other lining parameters shall be set to NIL in this case). If the LiningThickness is NIL it denotes that the value is not available.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>ThresholdDepth</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifcpositivelengthmeasure.htm">IfcPositiveLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Depth (dimension in plane perpendicular to door leaf) of the door threshold. Only given if the door lining includes a threshold. If omitted (and with a given value to threshold thickness) it indicates an adjustable depth (i.e. a depth that adjusts to the thickness of the wall into which the occurrence of this door style is inserted).

</td></tr>
<tr><td>ThresholdThickness</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifcnonnegativelengthmeasure.htm">IfcNonNegativeLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Thickness of the door threshold as explained in the figure above. If ThresholdThickness value is 0. (zero) it denotes a door without a threshold (ThresholdDepth shall be set to NIL in this case). If the ThresholdThickness is NIL it denotes that the information about a threshold is not available.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>TransomThickness</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifcnonnegativelengthmeasure.htm">IfcNonNegativeLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Thickness of the transom.
For a door, it is the thickness (width in plane parallel to door leaf) of the transom (if provided - that is, if the TransomOffset attribute is set), which divides the door leaf from a glazing (or window) above. If the TransomThickness is set to zero (and the TransomOffset set to a positive length), then the door is divided vertically into a leaf and transom window area without a physical frame.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>TransomOffset</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifclengthmeasure.htm">IfcLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Offset of the transom (if given) which divides the door leaf from a glazing (or window) above. The offset is given from the bottom of the door opening.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>LiningOffset</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifclengthmeasure.htm">IfcLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Offset of the lining.
For a door, it is the offset (dimension in plane perpendicular to door leaf) of the door lining. The offset is given as distance to the x axis of the local placement.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>ThresholdOffset</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifclengthmeasure.htm">IfcLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Offset (dimension in plane perpendicular to door leaf) of the door threshold. The offset is given as distance to the x axis of the local placement. Only given if the door lining includes a threshold and the parameter is known.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>CasingThickness</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifcpositivelengthmeasure.htm">IfcPositiveLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Thickness of the casing.
For a door, it is the dimension in plane of the door leaf. If given it is applied equally to all four sides of the adjacent wall.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>CasingDepth</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifcpositivelengthmeasure.htm">IfcPositiveLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Depth of the casing.
For a door, it is the dimension in the plane perpendicular to door leaf. If given it is applied equally to all four sides of the adjacent wall.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>LiningToPanelOffsetX</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifclengthmeasure.htm">IfcLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Offset between the lining and the panel, measured along the x-axis of the local placement.
For a door, it is the offset between the lining and the window panel.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>LiningToPanelOffsetY</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">P_SINGLEVALUE</span>
/
<a href="../../ifcmeasureresource/lexical/ifclengthmeasure.htm">IfcLengthMeasure</a>
</td><td>
Offset between the lining and the panel, measured along the y-axis of the local placement.
For a door, it is the offset between the lining and the door panel.
